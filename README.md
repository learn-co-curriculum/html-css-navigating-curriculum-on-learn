# Navigating Curriculum on Learn

## Overview

At this point, you've created a Learn account and set up an integrated development environment (more on that later).

Now, you're here in Learn and ready to start learning.

Before you start, let's just get a little more familiar with how Learn works. In the handful of lessons that follow, we'll walk you through a few things:

1. How content is organized on Learn
2. What the terminal is and how Learn mimics the way you would use a terminal 
3. The standard Learn workflow

Let's start by talking about the different parts of the curriculum on Learn.

## All About Lessons

The individual pieces of curriculum on Learn are called "lessons."

### Tracks and Navigation

A "track" is composed of many lessons, often organized into topics.

Click on the track name above to pop open Track Navigation, which allows you to view topics and units and move between lessons.

You must complete a lesson before you advance to the next one.

Lessons you've completed will be filled in with a green circle, and your current lesson will be orange.

### Lesson Types

There are two types of lessons on Learn: READMEs and Labs.

#### Labs

Labs are lessons with a coding challenge you must complete. A lab will require you to write code and submit a solution.

All labs include a README that you will see on Learn. The lab README will describe the objectives, overview, and instructions for the code you must write. You should definitely read the lab README. If you're confused at any point, always go back to the README.

You'll know if a lesson on Learn is a lab by the actions the right column asks you to take. Labs will display the following on the right:

#### READMEs

READMEs are lessons that only have instructional content. They are designed to teach you something without challenging you to practice or implement the concept directly. The lesson you are currently reading is a README. Many of the READMEs in this track include both text and video. We encourage you to both watch the videos and read the text. 

READMEs provide context and exposition on a topic by breaking concepts down. READMEs are how you learn enough to solve a lab.

Some READMEs also contain brief interactive elements such as quizzes or little in-browser coding challenges.

Once you've completed a README, you should click the "I'm Done" button on the right. The "Next Lesson" button will light up, allowing you to proceed.

## Go!

Seeing as this lesson is a README, you're now done and ready to go to the next lesson. Click the "I'm Done" button and proceed to the next lesson.

Happy Learning!
